# Drowsiness-Detection-System-CNN-OpenCV
System that can detect the drowsiness of drivers using CNN developed in Python - OpenCV, Keras

The drowsiness of drivers is one of the main reasons behind road accidents. It is natural for drivers who frequent long routes to doze off when behind the steering wheel. Even stress and lack of sleep can cause drivers to feel drowsy while driving. This project aims to prevent and reduce such accidents by creating a drowsiness detection agent.  

Here, you will use Python, OpenCV, and Keras to build a system that can detect the closed eyes of drivers and alert them if ever they fall asleep while driving. Even if the driver’s eyes are closed for a few seconds, this system will immediately inform the driver, thereby preventing terrible road accidents. OpenCV will monitor and collect the driver’s images via a webcam and feed them into the deep learning model that will classify the driver’s eyes as ‘open’ or ‘closed.’
